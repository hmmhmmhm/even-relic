# Adding a Sandevistan Language

Sandevistan keeps application-owned localization in a typed locale registry.
The phone companion, shipped G2 HUD, route controls, weather labels, default
TODO titles, weekdays, OSM label selection, preference validation, and language
screen all derive from that registry.

User-authored TODO text, RSS article content, destination names, route
instructions, and the OSM default name are never translated.

## Required changes

Assume the new locale is Japanese with code `ja`.

### 1. Add one complete locale pack

Copy `src/i18n/locales/en.ts` to `src/i18n/locales/ja.ts`, translate every
string value, and preserve all keys:

```ts
import type { LocalePack } from "../locale-schema";

export const jaLocale = {
  code: "ja",
  nativeName: "日本語",
  browserTags: ["ja", "ja-JP"],
  direction: "ltr",
  phone: {
    // Every phone key from the English reference pack.
  },
  hud: {
    // Every shipped fast-HUD key.
  },
  route: {
    // Route controls and all three profile labels.
  },
  weather: {
    // All semantic WMO condition labels.
  },
  todos: {
    station: "駅へ移動",
    umbrella: "傘を持つ",
    route: "経路を確認",
  },
  weekdays: [
    "日曜日",
    "月曜日",
    "火曜日",
    "水曜日",
    "木曜日",
    "金曜日",
    "土曜日",
  ],
} as const satisfies LocalePack;
```

`LocalePack` is derived from the English reference pack. TypeScript rejects a
missing, misspelled, extra, or structurally incompatible translation key.
Use `direction: "rtl"` only when the phone language reads right to left.
The phone root derives its `lang` and `dir` attributes from this metadata; the
nested tactical HUD remains LTR so its fixed tile geometry never mirrors.

### 2. Register the pack once

Import the pack and add one entry to `src/i18n/locale-registry.ts`:

```ts
import { jaLocale } from "./locales/ja";

export const LOCALE_REGISTRY = {
  ko: koLocale,
  en: enLocale,
  ja: jaLocale,
} as const;
```

The `SupportedLocale` type, language choices, native label, persisted-value
validation, system-language matching, domain adapters, and map selection now
include Japanese automatically.

Keep registry entries in code order so the language screen remains
deterministic.

### 3. Add exactly three built-in RSS feeds

Add three unique public HTTPS entries to `server/news-feeds.js`:

```js
{
  id: "example-japan-latest",
  name: "Example Japan",
  url: "https://news.example.jp/latest.xml",
  locale: "ja",
},
```

The browser source manager and same-origin server allowlist import this same
catalog. Do not duplicate the feed in a client TypeScript file.

Built-in feed IDs and URLs must be unique. Feeds must return bounded RSS or Atom
XML without an upstream redirect. Custom sources remain separate and do not
count toward the three built-ins.

The current baseline is thirty registered languages and ninety built-in feeds.
For Google News, store final canonical topic URLs rather than short topic paths
that return a redirect.

## No other language branches

Do not add:

- a handwritten locale union;
- an option in `LanguageScreen`;
- a condition such as `locale === "ja"`;
- a route-copy object in `RouteControls`;
- a weather-label branch;
- a default TODO table;
- a `name:ja` branch in the map Worker; or
- a duplicate RSS URL in `server/news.js` or `src/rss-sources.ts`.

The generic map payload already preserves valid bounded OSM
`name:<language>` values and falls back to the OSM default name.

## Required verification

Run every command serially:

```bash
npx vitest run src/i18n/locale-registry.test.ts --no-file-parallelism --maxWorkers=1
npx vitest run src/rss-sources.test.ts --no-file-parallelism --maxWorkers=1
npm run typecheck
npm test
node --test --test-concurrency=1 tests/*.test.mjs
npm run verify:rss-live
npm run build
npm run test:sites
npm run pack
```

Add language-specific assertions for representative phone, HUD, weather, TODO,
and route strings. Registry tests verify pack structure, seven weekdays,
code/key consistency, native options, and fallback. RSS tests fail unless the
new locale has exactly three built-in feeds. The live verifier checks every
feed serially with an eight-second timeout and rejects redirects, non-200
responses, non-XML content, bodies over 1 MB, missing RSS/Atom roots, and empty
feeds.

The new locale must not change four-tile encoding, the `3/5/2/4` initial
transfer order, `3/5` page transfers, binocular output, busy-drop refresh, or
black-frame hide and restore.
