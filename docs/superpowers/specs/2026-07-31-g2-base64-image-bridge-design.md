# G2 Base64 Image Bridge Experiment Design

Date: 2026-07-31

Status: Approved design; awaiting written-spec review

## Goal

Measure whether reducing WebView-to-Even-App JSON expansion improves physical
G2 image refresh latency. The experiment changes only the representation of
`ImageRawDataUpdate.imageData` at the JavaScript bridge boundary.

## Context

The SDK accepts `number[]`, Base64 `string`, `Uint8Array`, or `ArrayBuffer` as
image data. Its current `Uint8Array` path normalizes bytes to `number[]` before
calling the Flutter WebView handler. A Base64 string remains a string and keeps
the same SDK `compressMode: 2` host contract.

The supplied hardware logs show that four image calls enter the in-flight
state together but settle progressively. This experiment can measure and
possibly reduce WebView serialization overhead. It cannot change native LZ4,
BLE packet scheduling, acknowledgments, or glasses firmware behavior.

## Alternatives considered

### Fork and edit the obfuscated npm bundle

Rejected for the first experiment. It creates a package-maintenance burden and
makes rollback harder before proving that representation affects hardware
latency.

### Add a local bridge adapter

Selected. A small typed adapter converts encoded bytes immediately before
constructing `ImageRawDataUpdate`. It preserves the installed SDK, isolates the
experiment behind a query parameter, and can later become a package patch only
if the hardware result passes.

### Add a native batch-image method

Deferred. A real `updateImageRawDataBatch` method could remove more bridge and
acknowledgment overhead, but it requires support in the Even App and possibly
the firmware. A Web plugin cannot introduce that host method by itself.

## Controlled routes

The query-free route remains the production control and resolves to the
existing array representation.

```text
Control:   /hud-canvas-fast?sdk=0.0.13&pipeline=4&format=png&bridge=array
Candidate: /hud-canvas-fast?sdk=0.0.13&pipeline=4&format=png&bridge=base64
```

Missing, empty, or unknown `bridge` values resolve to `array`. Only the literal
`bridge=base64` enables the candidate.

Both routes retain:

- SDK `0.0.13` and minimum Even App `2.2.6`;
- four-level Canvas PNG content;
- four 288×144 image containers;
- pipeline four and the existing tile order;
- unchanged-tile skipping;
- immediate busy-drop behavior with no queue, merge, retry, or replay;
- the same timeouts and success criteria.

## Data flow

The Canvas encoder continues to return one `Uint8Array` per target tile.

For `array`, the adapter passes the `Uint8Array` to the SDK exactly as today.
The SDK normalizes it to `number[]` during `toJson()`.

For `base64`, the adapter converts the bytes to a Base64 string without
changing the PNG payload. It then passes that string to
`ImageRawDataUpdate.imageData`. No decoded pixel data, tile geometry, palette,
or compression flag changes.

The Base64 conversion must work in bounded chunks rather than spreading a
large byte array into one function call. This avoids argument-count limits and
keeps behavior deterministic for all current tile sizes.

## Diagnostics

Each encode or refresh trace must identify the selected bridge mode. It must
also report the exact representation length before the host call:

- `array`: the character length of the JSON array value, calculated without
  allocating a second JSON string;
- `base64`: the Base64 string length;
- total encoded PNG bytes remain in the existing encode diagnostic.

Tile start, success, failure, timeout, in-flight count, and complete-refresh
durations remain unchanged so the new logs are directly comparable with the
existing hardware records.

## Error handling

Base64 conversion failures fail the accepted refresh immediately. They are not
retried and are never queued. A native `sendFailed`, timeout, or unsupported
string payload also remains a failed refresh; the next independent input may
try again.

The control route must remain available for immediate rollback.

## Automated verification

All tests run serially.

- The resolver enables only literal `bridge=base64`.
- Missing and invalid values select `array`.
- Known byte sequences produce the expected Base64 text.
- Chunk boundaries preserve exact byte order.
- Array and Base64 representation-length diagnostics are exact.
- Array mode passes the original `Uint8Array` to the SDK model.
- Base64 mode passes a string while preserving container ID and name.
- Query parsing reaches the fast transport without affecting other routes.
- Existing tile order, skip cache, busy-drop, timeout, and failure tests stay
  green.

## Physical gate

Run the two routes serially on the same phone, Even App, G2 firmware, battery
range, page, and content state. Allow one warm-up per route, then collect at
least five of each:

1. four-tile restore;
2. two-tile dashboard transition;
3. four-tile detail entry or exit;
4. hide, confirming the candidate does not regress the minimal black frame.

The Base64 candidate passes only if both eyes and all quadrants remain correct,
no `sendFailed`, timeout, or WebView freeze appears, and median content refresh
improves beyond ordinary run-to-run noise. A smaller bridge representation by
itself is not a pass.

## Decision rule and rollback

Keep `array` as the default until the physical gate passes. If Base64 is not
meaningfully faster, retain it only as an explicit diagnostic or remove the
adapter. If it is faster and stable, promote the adapter in a separate change
while preserving `bridge=array` as the rollback route.

This experiment does not use native SDK text, add display layers, or change the
accepted Canvas HUD design.
