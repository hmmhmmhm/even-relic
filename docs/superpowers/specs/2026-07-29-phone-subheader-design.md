## Goal

Make the Sandevistan WebView header feel subordinate to the Even app's native
top bar. The WebView must retain clear navigation and screen identity without
looking like a second application-level navigation bar.

## Selected approach

Use a compact, inset section header across Home and detail screens.

- Home replaces the centered application title with a small left-aligned
  `SANDEVISTAN / DASHBOARD` section label.
- Detail screens use a compact row containing Back, a left-aligned screen
  title, and the existing optional action.
- Remove the opaque sticky surface and blur treatment from detail headers.
- Keep headers on the same light gray page surface as their content.
- Use the existing monochrome palette, typography, and Pixelarticons.
- Preserve a minimum 44 CSS-pixel touch target for Back and header actions.

This approach was selected over retaining the centered title bar because it
creates a clear hierarchy below the native Even bar. It was selected over
removing headers entirely because detail pages still need explicit navigation
and screen identity.

## Layout

### Home

The section header sits within the existing eight-pixel page inset. It is
40 pixels tall, left aligned, and visually lighter than the
`Dashboard` content heading. The HUD preview follows immediately below it.

### Detail screens

The detail header is 52 pixels tall and uses three columns:

1. A 44-pixel Back target.
2. A flexible, left-aligned title.
3. A 44-pixel optional action target.

The header remains sticky for navigation reliability, but its background is
transparent and has no blur, shadow, bottom border, or elevated card surface.
Content scrolling beneath it is therefore read as one WebView section rather
than a second application shell.

## Behavior and accessibility

- Existing Home card navigation is unchanged.
- Back navigation and optional actions retain their current behavior.
- The live Canvas stays mounted and the G2 transport is untouched.
- Long titles truncate on one line.
- Back and action controls retain accessible labels and 44-pixel targets.
- The compact hierarchy applies at all supported widths from 320 to 540
  pixels.

## Testing

- Add a component regression test for the Home section label.
- Add a component regression test proving detail navigation still exposes Back
  and the detail title.
- Add a style contract test for compact dimensions, transparent detail header
  surface, and the absence of backdrop blur.
- Run the full serial Vitest suite, TypeScript check, production build, and
  repository checks.

## Scope

This change affects only phone WebView header presentation. It does not alter
detail content, cards, phone persistence, glasses rendering, input handling,
image transport, or server APIs.
