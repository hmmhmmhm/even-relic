# G2 Hidden Input Diagnostic Design

Date: 2026-07-27  
Branch: `feature/g2-ors-routing`  
Status: APPROVED

## Goal

Identify why ring and glasses controls stop responding after the fast Canvas HUD
reports `HUD display completed`, without adding another glasses image transfer or
changing the approved black-frame hide interaction.

## Evidence and boundary

- The hide operation reaches its completion message, so the four-tile black
  transfer is not the operation currently blocking the JavaScript queue.
- While hidden, normal tap and scroll input are intentionally ignored.
- A double tap should remain accepted and restore the HUD, but neither the ring
  nor the glasses restores it.
- The unresolved boundary is therefore whether the hidden-state double-tap
  event reaches the WebView at all or reaches it in an event envelope that the
  current input normalizer does not recognize.

## Diagnostic behavior

The fast Canvas transport will expose an optional raw-event diagnostic callback.
It will run synchronously at the start of the existing `onEvenHubEvent`
listener, before hidden-state filtering or input normalization.

The callback receives a compact, immutable snapshot containing:

- whether the Canvas HUD is currently hidden;
- the raw `sysEvent.eventType`;
- the raw `textEvent.eventType`;
- the available system event source;
- a monotonically increasing event count for the transport session.

The app will use this callback only while the HUD is hidden. It will update the
phone WebView status with a compact message such as:

`Hidden input #3 · SYS 3 · TEXT - · SRC 2`

The callback must not draw the Canvas, encode a tile, request a live refresh, or
call any Even Hub bridge method. The glasses remain fully black during the
diagnostic.

## Interpretation

- If the phone status changes after a hidden-state double tap, the SDK event
  channel is alive. The captured fields identify the normalization or
  hidden-state routing defect to fix.
- If the phone status remains `HUD display complete`, the event does not reach the
  WebView. The follow-up fix will bound/coalesce pre-hide image work and input
  work so the native event channel is not saturated before entering hidden
  mode.

## Verification

Automated tests will prove that:

- raw event diagnostics run before an event is discarded in hidden mode;
- the snapshot preserves omitted event types rather than converting them to a
  click;
- diagnostic reporting causes no additional image encoding or transmission;
- cleanup prevents later diagnostic callbacks.

Type checking and the focused transport test must pass before serving the
diagnostic through the existing single Tailscale development server. The final
gate is one physical hidden-state double-tap from the ring or glasses.

## Scope

This step adds observation only. It does not change gesture semantics, queue
ordering, tile ordering, live refresh behavior, or the black-frame renderer.
The diagnostic hook will be removed or disabled after the failing boundary is
identified.
