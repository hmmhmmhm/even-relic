Result: PASS

## Physical G2 confirmation

The physical checkpoint opened the map build URL above after the
same-origin Overpass endpoint had returned live road geometry. The user
confirmed that the map was clearly visible:

> 네 잘보입니다.

The user also observed that nearby names were absent. That is the expected
scope of `live-map-014`; its approved implementation plan explicitly excluded
OSM street labels. Labels move to the separately approved
`map-labels-015` balanced-label design.

This short confirmation establishes visible live road geometry on the G2. It
does not independently establish an exact position heading, a physical
`2/4` transfer trace, absence of an HTTP request within one cache cell, or a
measured page-transition time.

## Automated and endpoint evidence

Before the physical checkpoint:

- `npm test`: 19 files, 211 tests passed with serial execution;
- `npm run typecheck`: exit 0;
- `npm run build`: exit 0;
- `npm run test:sites`: 4/4 tests passed;
- Tailscale HUD request: HTTP 200;
- live map response for the test cell: 180 roads, including 45 major and 135
  minor roads, with 1,373 total geometry points;
- attribution: `© OSM CONTRIBUTORS`.

The automated suite verifies the 650-meter fixed query, response limits,
projection bounds, left-only map refresh targeting, unchanged right-side page
transport, and hidden-frame restoration. Those internal conditions remain
automated evidence rather than separate physical observations.
